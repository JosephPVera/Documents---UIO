Guided to use the program 

* The nootebook contain different things with which you can play 
    ** The notebook varing_learning_rate as the name indicated is used mainly 
    to study the behavior when change the learning rate to minimized the energy,
    that meaning to find the optimal parameter but also the energy.

        *** It is not the only way you can use, en general you can play with the number
        Motecarlos cycles, number hidden layes and time step in Metropolis Hastings algorithmo 
        just varying these for different values  
    
    ** The notebook varing_learning_rate_and_satatistic mainly does the same that varing_learning_rate
    but now it calculate many ssampling for each rearning rate to applay the statistic technique.
        
        *** Note: You need to be careful because depent of number samplings it can spend more time. 

    ** The notebook statistic_analysis works to do a beeter estadistic analysis, you can choose
    between Bootstrap or Blocking statistic techniques and applay to data.

    ** The nootebook creat_many_samplings works to creat many sampling (Monte Carlos experiemntes)
    with the idea to apply after a statistic analysis, in this you will find hoe you can applay a 
    statistic between Bootstrap and Blocking
